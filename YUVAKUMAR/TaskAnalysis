Create a main folder named as DailyDataLoaded
Prepare The Schema Of Requirements
Give the seed data to central store
Create sub folders by using storecodes by using the seed  data
In first step we have read that  main central database store code matches to storecode sub folders  once the storecodes will matches it will enters the local subfolder bases on storecode folder
Once storecode is matched is matched in both databases then we have to process the files on that particular folder
In this criteria loop mechanism first executed on store codes
In this mechanism filenames are started with particular format like Store-yyyymmdd.csv ;Employee-yyyymmdd.pipe
In particular filenames have diffrent type of coloumns based on requirements
We sent some specifications of formatting the data with central database of storecode under related 
After that flatfiles of data was recieved from local databases 
We have matched that data with similar entities of data with central database of seed data schema like coloumns
The loop was generated on storecodes-filenames -records  similar with centarl store 
The loop was ended at one of the data does not matched  to central storecode filename records based 
After that the storecode was change to next in central store
Again all process must be repeated
In this scenario the processed files stored into seperate folder with particular path 
Any blocks on the process they have set an archieve file
In our sql server we have set up time of every 1hr local server was read all files
